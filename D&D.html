        <h1>Concept</h1>
        <p>D&D (or DND) is a tabletop roleplaying game (ttrpg). The only objective is to have fun with your friends. There is no winning. One of the people playing is the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM controls the world and all characters that aren't controled by a player. The players each have one character that they get to design and control. The players tell the DM what they want their characters to do and the DM explains the result of that action and the effect it has. The players may go on an adventure, defeating monsters and stopping villans, or maybe creating monsters and being villans! There is no right way to play DND.</p>

        <p>Often times, when a player tells the DM they want to do something, the DM will have them roll to determine how well they do that thing. The player then rolls a 20 sided die and adds their bonus to that roll to get the result. The bonus you add is dependant on what you are doing, and the DM will tell you which one to add. If you are trying to calm a horse, you might add you animal handleing bonus. If you are trying to jump over a wide gap, you might add you athletics bonus. The number for each of these bonuses is determined by how you create you character. When you make your character, you can speck to be good at certain things; sometimes really good! You might roll only and 8 but get to add another 6 on top of that to make the final product 14. This system allows players to have a sygnificant degree of control, but sill adds the tension, supprise, and luck that make the game so exciting at times! You will probably be able to sneak past the sleeping giant, but what if something goes wrong and you wake it up? It's always a possibility. There are other ways to swing the odds in your favor as well. Sometimes another player might assist you, causing you to have adavntage. When you have advantage you roll twice and take the higher number to add your bonus to. The opposite is true as well, with disadvantage from some sort of outside disturbance causing you to roll twice and use the lower number.</p>
